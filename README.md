# Copy-of-DARC

This is a reupload of https://github.com/dmksjfl/DARC. Some changes was made for main.py to run MountainCarContinuous-v0 for a school project.

The reward of each tuple in the replay buffer is now calculated based on the distance of the car from 0.45 (winning state) plus a small bonus when reaching 0.45.
